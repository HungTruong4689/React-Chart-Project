# Graph Dashboard Application

## Overview

This application is a Single Page Web Application (SPA) built using React and TypeScript. It leverages various libraries to create an interactive dashboard for displaying charts. The primary libraries used include MUI/React Bootstrap for UI components, Highcharts for chart visualization, and Redux for state management (optional). Additionally, middleware like Redux Thunk or Redux Saga can be integrated for advanced state management.
